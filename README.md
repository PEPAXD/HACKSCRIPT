# HACKSCRIPT
scare a user by reading his google history

The program looks for the default history file in the path ""AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/History""
If the user does not use the default installation path by default, the program will not work repeating in a loop 
"CANNOT ACCESS THE BROWSING HISTORY - RELOAD CHECK IN 5 SECONDS"

It also causes failure if the user does not default to the steam path "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\*"

This project is very simple and hasn't bad purpose...
currently I think google changed its cache and no the program doesn't work. I also share it with the community.
