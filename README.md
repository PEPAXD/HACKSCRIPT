# HACKSCRIPT
scare a user by reading his google history

The program looks for the default history file in the path ""AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/History""
If the user does not use the default installation path by default, the program will not work repeating in a loop 
"CANNOT ACCESS THE BROWSING HISTORY - RELOAD CHECK IN 5 SECONDS"

if the program works, it will create a .txt file on the desktop with all the user information

It also has the addition of reading the information of the steam games installed on the disk but it can cause failures if the user does not default to the steam path
"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\*"

This project is very simple and hasn't bad purpose...
currently I think google changed its cache and no the program doesn't work. I also share it with the community.
